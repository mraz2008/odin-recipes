    <h2 style="color: blue;">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 pounds large shrimps, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>8 wedges lemon for garnish</li>
         
        
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>preheat the grill / medium heat</li>
        <li>in a bowl, crush the garlic(without skin of course da!), add the salt using a fork</li>
        <li>add in the paprika, cayenne pepper, olive oil, and lemon juice in any order you want :( stir the mix to make a paste</li>
        <li>at this time, it is a good idea to taste the paste and adjust salt or the other ingredients until you like it</li>
        <li>now it is time to toss in the shrimp in the bowl and evenly coat the shrimps using your hands, you can use gloves of course!
        (you will get better results if you leave the marinated shrimps to rest for few hours before grilling/cooking it, but if you 
        can't wait....go for it it will still tast as good!)</li>
        <li>lightly oil the preheated grill and start grilling!... 2 to 3 minutes on each side is more than enough...enjoy the smell</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving dish if you managed to not eat everthing off the grill! and garnish with the lemon wedges if they were not used making cocktails...ooops guilty!</li>
        <li> YOU CAN EAT NOW</li>
